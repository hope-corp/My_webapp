### Why this caused the error:
Jinja2 starts reading your `index.html` from the top. When it hits `{% end block %}` (with the space), it doesn't recognize it as a "close" command. It thinks you are trying to start a new command but forgot a "token" (a specific character like a quote or a bracket). 

### Final Check for your `base.html`
Since we are using `{% extends "base.html" %}`, make sure your `base.html` has the "receiver" for this content. It should look like this:

```html
<body>
    <nav>...</nav>

    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}

    <footer>...</footer>
</body>
